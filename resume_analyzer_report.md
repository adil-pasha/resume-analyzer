## üìê System Prompt Design and Justification

### Prompt Logic:
Although this app doesn‚Äôt use a system prompt for an LLM, it simulates the same idea through deterministic Python logic and pre-defined keyword sets.

### Logic Breakdown:
- **Role-specific keywords**: Loaded from `sample_keywords.json`
- **Text match engine**: Matches resume input with keywords using simple `.lower()` comparison
- **Analysis engine**: Divides keywords into "found" and "missing"
- **Feedback module**: Gives tailored advice based on results

### Design Choices:
- No dependency on API = No latency, no rate limits, no key rotation issues.
- Deterministic string matching = Predictable and explainable output.
- JSON-based roles = Easy to expand with more job roles.

### Anticipated Impact:
- Students can easily check how their resume compares to a target job role.
- Provides clear suggestions to improve skills or resume formatting.
- Makes resume tailoring easier even without internet.
